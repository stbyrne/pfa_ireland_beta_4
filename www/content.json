The department provides hands-on representation for players at every stage of their career as well as offering ethical best advice at all times. It is important that a player seeks advice and representation in contractual negotiations with a club, and the quality of that advice and representation is crucial. The sole aim of our Agency will always be the best interests of the player. Regulations introduced by FIFA require players and clubs to deal only with licensed agents for transfer and contract negotiations.The PFAI has a designated officer whom is a licensed players’ agent and is able to advise and represent players on all aspects of their contracts at the time of re-signing or when being transferred. In Stephen McGuinness, the PFAI has a leading representative who has negotiated at the highest level and has made a major impact on the working conditions and benefits for all players. In an industry where a player’s life can change in a short space of time from being a youth player to a professional player with a lucrative contract, sound financial advice is essential.We are delighted that many of our members throughout the League of Ireland and the Schoolboys Leagues have become clients of the PFAI and thus have ensured that their futures are secure.<br>A major benefit to any client of the Agency is that the majority of services that a player requires are provided internally and not out-sourced to other companies.<br><br><b>About the Agency</b><br>The PFAI has many benefits outlined below as well as three offices in Dublin’s National Sports Campus in Abbotstown, Dublin. The PFAI team will provide assistance on every aspect of a footballer’s career, letting the player concentrate on playing.<br>As part of the continued expansion of the PFAI’s services we are representing underage players when signing a new or extended professional contract or scholars contract in the UK. Our solicitor, Stuart Gilhooly, will finalise all contracts where required. He is a registered lawyer with the English Football Association; his registration number is RLG728 and he is in a position to assist in the provision of football agency services.<br>The PFAI is in a unique position as we are directly linked to the English PFA and PFA Scotland through FIFPro, the world players’ union, and we can also assist in any difficulties players may have in relation to settling in at a club as we have direct links to the FAI’s Player Welfare Officer in the UK.<br>Our Association will also be the first point of contact for players who want to pursue or who return from the UK after a professional career in Ireland or who return after a scholar’s contract or professional contract. The PFAI will work to find employment for all players and will help fund education, legal and accountancy advice.<br>The PFAI is a non-profit organisation and isn’t driven like a lot of football agents to make as much money for themselves as possible and are not concerned at all if the player’s career does not work out. Our only concern is the player and his welfare both on and off the field.<br>The senior Irish international team are all members of the PFAI and this shows the level of our professionalism, as well as the respect in which our Association is held."
